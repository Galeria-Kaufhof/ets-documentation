# ETS Documentation - Start

## What is the ETS project?

ETS is a collection of components and practices which allow to build applications and libraries with Scala.

It is a software development framework and ecosystem consisting of:

- A strictly managed and reliably versioned Maven POM set which allows to build Scala libraries or applications where conflict-free interoperation of all ETS-covered external dependencies their transitive dependencies is guaranteed

- A collection of useful libraries built on top of this approach, which are guaranteed to work seamlessly with ETS-covered external dependencies and other ETS libraries

- A collection of Maven archetypes which allows to quickly bootstrap library or application projects that make use of the ETS ecosystem out-of-the-box.
